# Next.js Project

This project is a Next.js application, leveraging React for server-rendered applications.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, use any of the following commands:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- `yarn dev`
- `pnpm dev`
- `bun dev`

Access the result at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser. Start modifying the `pages/index.js` fileâ€”the page will auto-update as you make changes.

API routes are available at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). Modify the API endpoint in `pages/api/hello.js`. Files in the `pages/api` directory function as API routes instead of React pages.

This project optimizes and loads Inter, a custom Google Font, using `next/font`.

## Deployment

The simplest deployment method for your Next.js app is via the Vercel Platform, developed by the creators of Next.js. Refer to the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for comprehensive details.
